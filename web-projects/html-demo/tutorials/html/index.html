        <h2>Unemployed</h2>
        <p>
            I am a reliable, adaptable and motivated worker, efficient and precise, with commitment to finishing jobs quickly and accurately. With a friendly, approachable and considerate nature, I work well with colleagues and am also able to confidently complete tasks using my own initiative.<br>
            With a flexible attitude and possessing the ability to adapt well to different roles, I am currently looking for a new opportunity where I can use my existing skills but also learn from any training provided and work experience to fulfil the requirements of the advertised role.
        </p>
